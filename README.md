##Link to app:
https://floating-sierra-1092.herokuapp.com/

##Technologies used:
Express, mongo, node, Bootstrap, underscore, jQuery, and javascript.

##Directions for installing:
Clone the directory to your computer and use npm install to install all the dependences. If you wish to contribute to this project, fork the repo it before you clone it.

##Future Goals:
Remove the "Fave" button from recipes that a user has already favorited.

To allow users to add notes to existing recipes that only they would be able to view.

Users would also be able to add their own recipes to the database that would be searchable and could be favorited by other users.

A users favorites should be sorted by type of dish(Entree, dessert, breakfast, ect).
